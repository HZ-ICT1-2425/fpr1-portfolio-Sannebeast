        <p>
        The most important question to ask myself is why? Why HBO? Why ICT? Why am I here on the HZ?<br>
        But what is my motivation behind everything? What's my motivation to study HBO-ICT on HZ in Middelburg?
        To find out what my intrinsic motivation is, I've to ask myself lots of why's. So let's start with it!<br>
        <br>
        <b>Why did I choose for ICT?</b><br>
        I choose for ICT because I always liked play games and<br>
        I was curious about how the pc works and why.<br><br>
        <b>Why do I want to know about pc's?</b><br>
        I want to know about pc's because<br>
        I want to understand what I'm working with<br><br>
        <b>Why do I want to understand working with pc's?</b><br>
        It makes me feel less helpless when<br>
        a simple bug pops on the screen<br><br>
        <b>Why don't I want to feel helpless?</b><br>
        I don't want to feel helpless because<br>
        I like to have everything in my control.<br>
        It makes me comfortable knowing I have control over the situation.<br>
        Generally I am just curious about how a pc works.<br><br>

            Sometimes you need to convince colleagues to think about using educational technology in their lessons, or
            to identify where in their scheme of work they could incorporate it.<br><br>

            This list is a starting point: you may find one or two points that would 'resonate' with your co-worker, and
            grab his or her attention.<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Where information and communications technology (ICT) is taught well, it has been shown to enhance
                pupils’ levels of understanding and attainment in other subjects. That’s because “real” ICT is more
                about thinking skills than about mastering particular software applications.</li>
            <li>ICT can provide both the resources and the pedagogical framework for enabling pupils to become effective
                independent learners. For example, computer programs are available that adjust themselves to the pupils’
                level and then set appropriate tasks and give feedback on performance. Used wisely, these can help
                pupils to move on.</li>
            <li>Also, newer technologies such as Web 2.0 applications enables pupils and others to collaborate in ways
                that reflect a broadly constructivist approach to education.</li>
            <li>ICT places all learners on an equal footing. Given the right hardware, software and curriculum
                activities, even severely physically disadvantaged pupils can achieve the same degree of success as
                anyone else.</li>
            <li>ICT has been shown to have benefits in terms of motivating pupils. That comes about partly through
                factors like being able to produce nice-looking work with no teacher’s red marks all over it, and partly
                because the computer is seen as being impartial and non-judgemental in its feedback to the pupil.</li>
            <li>ICT enables pupils to gather data that would otherwise be difficult or even impossible to obtain. For
                example, data from inaccessible places (eg outer space), inaccessible times (eg overnight), from both
                overseas and nationally on demand (without having to physically go anywhere) or data at very precise
                time intervals.</li>
            <li>ICT enables pupils to gather data that would otherwise be time-consuming or costly or both. For example,
                pupils can use the internet to get up-to-the-minute information on prices. They can use a DVD or the
                internet to watch movies of old dictators speaking, or the moon landings, or to listen to a piece of
                music by Mozart.</li>
            <li>ICT enables pupils to experiment with changing aspects of a model, which may be difficult or even
                impossible for them to do otherwise. For example, pupils of Business Studies and Economics can see what
                might happen to the economy if interest rates were raised or lowered. Pupils can use webcams to capture
                the development of an egg or a plant.</li>
            <li>ICT enables pupils to draft or redraft their work until they are satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Another reason to use ICT in lessons is because it can help to implement personalised learning.</li>
            <li>Pupils usually enjoy using computers and other types of technology, so lessons which make use of it
                start off with an advantage (which is all too often squandered).</li>
            <li>Educational technology puts the pupil in control (if it is well-designed), enabling her to personalise
                the interface, select and create resources, and even choose what to learn.</li>
            <li>Just about every aspect of modern life involves educational technology; therefore, to not make use of it
                in the curriculum is anachronistic.</li>
            <li>Because educational technology pervades all aspects of modern society, schools have a duty of care to
                ensure that pupils understand issues such as keeping safe online, protecting their identity, recognising
                good and misleading information sources on the internet, the effects of educational technology on
                communications and the economy, to name but a few issues.</li>
